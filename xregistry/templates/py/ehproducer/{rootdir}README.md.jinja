# {{ project_name | capitalize }} Azure Event Hubs Producer SDK for Python

This is the {{ project_name | capitalize }} Azure Event Hubs Producer SDK for Python. It was generated from the xRegistry CLI tool
based on message catalog messages for {% for messagegroupid, _ in messagegroups.items() %}"{{ messagegroupid }}"{%- if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{%- endfor %}.

## Quick Install

To get started quickly, the main package can be installed with the `install.sh`
script (or `install.bat` on Windows) in the root of the repository.

### Contents

The repository contains two projects.
* The `{{project_name}}_eventhubs_producer` project is the main project that
  contains the Event Hubs producer client code.
* The `{{ data_project_name }}` project contains the data classes for the event
  payload data.

The classes defined in `{{project_name}}_eventhubs_producer` are documented
in the project [README](./{{project_name}}_eventhubs_producer/README.md).

The `{{project_name}}_eventhubs_producer` project depends on the
`{{ data_project_name }}` project.

If you want to install the producer project, you can run the following command:

```bash
pip install ./{{project_name}}_eventhubs_producer
```

This will install both packages. If you only want to install the data project,
you can run the following command:

```bash
pip install ./{{ data_project_name }}
```

## Build and Test

The SDK comes with a full test suite for the data classes and the producers
that uses the `pytest` framework and Docker containers to run the tests.

If you have Docker installed and if you have `make`, you can run the tests with
the following command:

```bash
make test
```

If you don't have `make` installed, you can run the following commands:

```bash
pip install ./{{main_project_name}}
pytest ./{{main_project_name}}/tests ./{{data_project_name}}/tests
```

## Usage

The sample code in [samples/sample.py](samples/sample.py) demonstrates how to
use the Event Hubs producer client to send messages to an Event Hub.

Event producers wrap the `EventHubProducerClient` and are responsible for
constructing and sending messages to the Event Hub using that client. Multiple
producers can be used concurrently with the same `EventHubProducerClient`.

{%- set messagegroupid, messagegroup = messagegroups.items()|first %}
{%- set message_id, message = messagegroup.messages.items()|first %}
{%- set groupname = messagegroupid | pascal %}
{%- set class_name = ( groupname | strip_dots ) + "EventProducer" %}
The required parameters for the generated `send` methods are:
* `data`: The event data to be sent.
* `content_type`: The content type that the event data shall be sent with.
* additional parameters depend on the message catalog information.

The example below shows how to create and send an event:

```python
producer = EventHubProducerClient.from_connection_string("your-connection-string", eventhub_name="your-eventhub-name")
event_producer = {{ (messagegroupid | pascal | strip_dots) + "EventProducer" }}(producer)
data = {{ data_type | strip_namespace }}(...)  # Construct your event data here
await event_producer.send_{{ messageid | dotunderscore | lower }}(data=data, content_type="application/json")
```
{%- endfilter %}
