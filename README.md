## What is xRegistry?

The [xRegistry project](https://xregistry.io/) run by the CNCF Serverless WG
defines a generic, extensible, and interoperable registry for metadata and
metadata documents. In particular, it is designed to support registries that aid
with the discovery and description of messaging and eventing endpoints and
therefore has three built-in registries for (payload-)schemas, message
definitions, and endpoints.

xRegistry defines both an API and a document format for managing metadata and
one of its key characteristics is that the REST API and the document model are
symmetrical. An HTTP endpoint path in the API corresponds to a JSON pointer path
in the document model.

All metadata resources are organized in groups, and each group can contain
multiple resources. Some resources allow for maintaining multiple versions, as
it is the case for schemas.

The xRegistry API and document model is defined in the
[xRegistry API specification](https://github.com/xregistry/spec).

## xRegistry Message Catalogs

xRegistry Message Catalogs are a set of registries that are built on top of
xRegistry and are designed to support the discovery and description of messaging
and eventing endpoints. The following catalogs are defined:

-   **Schema Catalog**: A registry for schemas that can be used to validate
    messages.
-   **Message Catalog**: A registry for message definitions that describe the
    structure of messages. Messages can be defined as abstract, transport
    neutral envelopes based on [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) or as concrete
    messages that are bound to a specific transport protocol, whereby AMQP, HTTP, MQTT,
    and Apache Kafka are directly supported. Each message definition can associated
    with a schema from the schema catalog for describing the message payload.
-   **Endpoint Catalog**: A registry for endpoints that can be used to send or
    receive messages. Each endpoint can be associated with one or more groups of
    message definitions from the message catalog.

The three catalogs are designed to be used together, with the endpoint catalog
referring to message definition groups and message definitions referring to schemas.

You can study some examples of xRegistry Message Catalog documents in the
samples directory of this repository:

-   [**Contoso ERP**](samples/message-definitions/contoso-erp.xreg.json): A
    simple example of a message catalog for a fictional ERP system.
-   [**Inkjet Printer**](samples/message-definitions/inkjet.xreg.json): A
    fictitious group of events as they may be raised by an inkhet printer.
-   [**Fabrikam Motorsports**](samples/message-definitions/fabrikam-motorsports.xreg.json):
    An example for an event stream as it may be used in a motorsports telemetry
    scenario.
-   [**Vacuum Cleaner**](samples/message-definitions/vacuumcleaner.xreg.json):
    A fictitious group of events as they may be raised by a vacuum cleaner.

## Installation

The tool requires Python 3.10 or later. Until the tool is published in an
official package source (_this is a prototype, remember?_), you can install the
tool with pip directly from the repo:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/clemensv/cloudevents-registry-cli.git
```

If you want to develop locally and/or run the included tests follow the
instructions in [Development Environment](docs/development_environment.md).

## Usage

The tool is invoked as `xregistry` and supports the following subcommands:

- `xregistry manifest`: Generate a manifest document (a file-based catalog) for a s et of schemas and definitions
- `xregistry catalog`: Interact with a catalog service (specifically [https://github.com/duglin/xreg-github/](https://github.com/duglin/xreg-github/) at the moment; no authNZ supported yet)
- `xregistry generate`: Generate code
- `xregistry validate`: Validate a definition
- `xregistry list`: List available templates

### Manifest and Catalog commands

The `manifest` and `catalog` commands allow you to interact with the xRegistry catalog service and manage manifests, endpoints, message groups, messages, and schemas.

Run `xregistry manifest --help` or `xregistry catalog --help` for more information.

### Generate

The `generate` subcommand generates code from a definition file. The tool
includes a set of built-in language/style template sets that can be enumerated
with the [List](#list) command.

The `generate` command takes the following options:

| Option             | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--projectname`    | **Required** The project name (namespace name) for the generated code.                                                                                                             |

```

Especially noteworthy might be the support for both AsyncAPI and OpenAPI.

##### OpenAPI

The tool can generate AsyncAPI definitions for producer endpoints with:

```shell
xregistry generate --language=openapi --style=producer --projectname=MyProjectProducer --definitions=definitions.json --output=MyProjectProducer
```

This will yield a `MyProjectProducer/MyProjectProducer.yml' file that can be used to generate a
producer client for the given endpoint.

Similarly, the tool can generate OpenAPI definitions for subscriber endpoints with:

```shell
xregistry generate --language=openapi --style=subscriber --projectname=MyProjectSubscriber --definitions=definitions.json --output=MyProjectSubscriber
```

This will yield a `MyProjectSubscriber/MyProjectSubcriber.yml' file that can be
used to generate a subscriber server for the given endpoint, which is compatible
with the CloudEvents Subscription API.

##### AsyncAPI

The tool can generate AsyncAPI definitions with:

```shell
xregistry generate --language=asyncapi --style=producer --projectname=MyProjectProducer --definitions=definitions.json --output=MyProjectProducer
```

For AsyncAPI, the tool support an extension parameter ce_content_mode that can be used to control the CloudEvents content mode of the generated AsyncAPI definition. The default is "structured" and the other supported value is "binary". The AsyncAPI template supports HTTP, MQTT, and AMQP 1.0 endpoints and injects the appropriate headers for the selected content mode for each protocol.

Use it like this:

```shell
xregistry generate --language=asyncapi --style=producer --projectname=MyProjectProducer --definitions=definitions.json --output=MyProjectProducer --template-args ce_content_mode=binary
```

#### Custom Templates

The tool supports custom templates. Custom templates reside in a directory and are organized in subdirectories for each language and style. The directory structure is the same as the built-in templates. The tool will look for custom templates in the directories specified with the `--templates` option. Custom templates take precedence over built-in templates.

For more information on how to write custom templates, see [authoring templates](docs/authoring_templates.md).

If you are building a custom template that might be generally useful, submit a PR for includion into the built-in template set.

### Validate

The `validate` subcommand validates a definition file. The tool will report any errors in the definition file.

The `validate` command takes the following options:

| Option             | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--definitions`    | The path to a local file or a URL to a file containing xRegistry definitions. |
| `--requestheaders` | Extra HTTP headers for HTTP requests to the given URL in the format `key=value`.         |

### List

The `list` subcommand lists the available language/style template sets.

## Testing

### Dependency Resolution Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing for the xRegistry loader's dependency resolution functionality:

```bash
# Run the comprehensive dependency resolution test suite
python test_xregistry_dependencies.py
```

This test suite validates:
- ✅ **Fragment Reference Resolution**: All internal JSON pointer references (`#/messagegroups/...`, `#/schemagroups/...`)
- ✅ **Document Composition**: Complete document assembly with all dependencies resolved
- ✅ **Real-World Validation**: Testing with actual xRegistry files from the `/test/xreg` directory
- ✅ **Endpoint Dependencies**: Specific validation of endpoint dependencies and schema references

**Test Results**: 100% dependency resolution success rate across all test files (26 total references).
